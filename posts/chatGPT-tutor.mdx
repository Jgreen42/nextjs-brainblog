### short conversation code help

the code may not work and chat gpt can produce false results it is meant to be a guide essentially in this project. You start with the core concept and work outwords in different levels and chatgpt tends to do better that way. Just like image generating.
mostly im doing this so I can access the code via my micro controlers with out having to deal with all the authentication updates ect.... enjoy the chaos I ended up researching some articles and found some code that is more authentic and I chopped it up abit and got the raspberry pi to recognise the oled display through the terminal and I ran the code adjusted the font ect. all in all was a fun project look forward to more! Ill post more on the how I achieved it later.
