### short conversation code help

the code me not work and chat gpt can produce false results it meant to be a guide essentially in this project. you start with the core concept and work out words in different levels and chatgpt tends to do better that way. Just like image generating.
mostly im doing this so I can access the code via my micro controlers with out having to deal with all the authentication updates ect.... enjoy the chaos
