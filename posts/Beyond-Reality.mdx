*Intoxicating*, *Exhilarating*, *Groundbreaking*


I first discovered AI-generated images through social media and Google Colab notebooks. These notebooks utilized pre-written code blocks that you could run on dedicated GPUs or RAM, allowing you to modify prompts and generate extremely unique content. It was evident to me that this breakthrough technology had the potential to revolutionize the field.

To stay up-to-date with the latest trends in AI-generated content, I relied on AdSense technology, which provided me with relevant information. During this time, I stumbled upon OpenAI and eagerly signed up for beta testing. Although it was challenging initially, I eventually learned how to guide the AI to produce remarkable abstract pieces, often relying on luck to achieve a certain level of accuracy.

As time went on, OpenAI released updates and added new tools. I also began experimenting with leonardo.ai, which granted me the freedom to create image after image while honing specific aspects of the AI's artistic process. It was incredible to be able to depict representations of my dreams or create images inspired by them, even if they weren't exact replicas.
The feeling of having this creative power was intoxicating. 

Some individuals were producing content on the fly, akin to rolling the dice and creating cool artwork. However, the ability to paint your dreams and thoughts using AI technology was simply astonishing. I excitedly shared my discoveries with my brother and family, attempting to explain the magnitude of this imminent technological advancement.
Unfortunately, my family had difficulty comprehending the significance of what I was showing them. Accustomed to the constant stream of new applications, they couldn't grasp the profound impact of this development. However, my brother Tony understood and he and I continued to explore and experiment with code, facing trials, errors, and the occasional bout of imposter syndrome.

To witness OpenAI's transition from beta testing to its current state and be a part of the tinkering process that shaped dalle2 fills me with a sense of honor. Experiencing such magic firsthand has been a remarkable journey.
This moment is undeniably a turning point in AI's journey towards singularity. It parallels significant technological advancements like the production of cell phones, TVs, cars, DNA sequencing, and plastic. I firmly believe that this is only the beginning. Once AI becomes fully integrated into our daily lives, there will be a world of innovation and possibilities awaiting us.

#### I feel it is important to just enjoy the journey and Enjoy what you do! This is what fuels innovation!
